        "Drinking water infrastructure is critical to a safe and healthy population. Every living being needs safe and clean drinking water, in fact, it's one of the [UN's Sustainable Development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). While, the U.S. does have better drinking water quality and infrastructure compared to many places, the quality of drinking water is not equal everywhere in the U.S. The U.S. has old infrastructure and repairs and maintenance are lagging, especially in places with limited public spending. The older pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water with materials we don't want to drink such as lead. The most famous recent (and ongoing) case of this is in Flint, Michigan where city employees tried to cut costs on water allowing 'hard' (mineral dense) water from the Flint River enter old pipes and corrode them so that they contaminated the drinking water with lead. Another famous example is of water that was capable of catching on fire in West Virginia after a chemical that is used to clean coal was spilled. Other places that have had issues with water include Jackson, Mississippe, NYC, Baltimore, MD, and others. These cases show just how critical it is that we ensure our water quality and the infrastructure that brings us our water is up to date and properly functioning.\n",

The dataset is also called the Municipal Drinking Water Database (MDWD) and uses data from the Census to help researchers interested in learning more about drinking water and factors that influence it.
