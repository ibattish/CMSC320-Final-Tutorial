(Discussion of why our topic is important and research questions/goals and literature review)


Drinking water infrastructure is critical to a safe and healthy population. Every living being needs safe and clean drinking water, in fact, it's one of the [UN's Sustainable Development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). While, the U.S. does have better drinking water quality and infrastructure compared to many places, the quality of drinking water is not equal everywhere in the U.S. The U.S. has old infrastructure and repairs and maintenance are lagging, especially in places with limited public spending. The older pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water with materials we don't want to drink such as lead. The most famous recent (and ongoing) case of this is in Flint, Michigan where city employees tried to cut costs on water allowing 'hard' (mineral dense) water from the Flint River enter old pipes and corrode them so that they contaminated the drinking water with lead. Another famous example is of water that was capable of catching on fire in West Virginia after a chemical that is used to clean coal was spilled. Other places that have had issues with water include Jackson, Mississippe, NYC, Baltimore, MD, and others. These cases show just how critical it is that we ensure our water quality and the infrastructure that brings us our water is up to date and properly functioning.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the Data Science Pipeline.
1. Data Collection
2. Data Processing
3. Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization
4. Anaylysis and Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning
5. Insight and Policy Decision.

We hope that this walkthrough will show insights on the U.S. drinking water infrastructure, while also shedding light on potential risk areas in drinking water.

Throughout this tutorial we will analyze a variety of factors, and how they pertain to drinking water. (MORE ABOUT VARIABLES WE'LL ANALYZE HERE).

Picking out variables I think may be fun to use, looking at the tutorials we may want to do like 5-7 or smth
- Democrat vote share in 2016
- source of drinking water
- Health Expenditures
- Park & Rec Expenditures
- Water Utility Construction Costs
- Water Utility Total Costs
- Water Utility Revenue
- Taxes in an area
- a place's moisture index
- number of full time employees in a municipality
- total number of health violations
- median income
- population
- Black population
- state & year
